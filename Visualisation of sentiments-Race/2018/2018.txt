INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HIS EXCELLENCY, NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO, ON THE OCCASION OF 
HIS SWEARING IN AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE GHANA ARMED 
FORCES. 
DATE: 7TH JANUARY, 2017
Mr Speaker,
The Ghanaian people give thanks to Almighty God for the blessings, favour and grace He continues to 
bestow on them. Exactly a month ago, that is 7th December last year, 2016, we, the people of Ghana, in 
all serenity and dignity, exercised our democratic franchise freely to elect a President and Parliament of 
our Republic. We are met here today to give effect to the outcome of that exercise. 
In accordance with our republican custom, I, having been declared the winner of the presidential 
contest on 9th December, 2016, by the returning officer, the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission, 
Charlotte Osei, have taken the oath of the high office of President of the Republic, in the presence of the 
newly sworn Vice President, His Excellency Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, and the newly elected 
Speaker of Parliament, the Rt. Hon. Prof. Michael Oquaye, an oath administered by the Chief Justice, Her 
Ladyship Georgina Theodora Wood, before the elected representatives of the people assembled in this 
7th Parliament of the 4th Republic. This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Our nation is honoured by the presence, at this solemn ceremony of investiture, of leaders and 
representatives of friendly countries across the globe, in particular those of the sister nations of our 
regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of our continental body, 
the African Union. I salute the Chairperson of the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of the 
AU, His Excellency Idriss Déby, President of the Republic of Chad. 
I salute the Chairperson of the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS, the historic 
figure, Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia; our special guest of 
honour, His Excellency Alassane Dramane Ouattara, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, and we 
thank him for his excellent speech; His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal 
Republic of mighty Nigeria; His Excellency Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal; His 
Excellency Faure Gnassingbé, President of the Republic of Togo; His Excellency Alpha Condé, President 
of the Republic of Guinea Conakry; His Excellency Patrice Talon, President of the Republic of Benin; His 
Excellency Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone; His Excellency Ibrahim 
Boubacar Keïta, President of the Republic of Mali; His Excellency Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, President 
of Burkina Faso. We are grateful also for the presence of His Excellency Teodoro Obiang Nguema, 
President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea; His Excellency Ali Bongo, President of the Republic of 
Gabon; and His Excellency Edgar Lungu, President of the Republic of Zambia. To them and the 
representatives of all the other friendly nations who are here, and former presidents and leaders, I say 
‘akwaaba’, our famous word of welcome.
I have, at the outset, to thank sincerely our departing President, His Excellency John Dramani Mahama, 
for his service to our nation. He stepped into the breach of national leadership at a delicate moment in 
the country’s history, with the death in office, for the first time, of a sitting president, the late Prof. John 
Evans Atta Mills. He has since steered the ship of state with conviction. 
His elegant, dignified acceptance of the verdict of the people on 7th December, 2016, will, without 
doubt, receive the approval of history, for it has contributed significantly to the process of democratic 
consolidation in Ghana. I wish him and his family well. 
For myself, I am in the unique position of being able to draw on the wisdom and experience of three 
former Presidents of the Republic, their Excellencies Jerry John Rawlings, John Agyekum Kufuor and John 
Dramani Mahama. They represent the continuity of the institutions of our Republic, for which we thank 
God.
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply humbled by the exceptional mandate and extraordinary show of confidence 
that the Ghanaian people have conferred on my party, the New Patriotic Party, and on my modest 
person. I am determined to do all in my power to accomplish the tasks of the mandate and justify their 
confidence. I will not let you, the people of Ghana, down.
We have a proud heritage. We are the heirs of John Mensah Sarbah, Joseph Caseley Hayford, George Pa 
Grant, R.S. Blay, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, Edward Akufo-Addo, William 
Ofori-Atta, Cobbina Kesse, Ernest Ako Adjei, Kwame Nkrumah, Komla Agbeli Gbedema, Kojo Botsio, S.D. 
Dombo, Kofi Abrefa Busia, Baffuor Osei Akoto and others, who taught us that fidelity to principles, 
courage, patience, resilience and collective action do yield results. 
They fought with intelligence, guts, steely determination and patriotism to liberate our land and reclaim 
our worth as human beings. Their love for country continues to inspire generations of us to commit our 
lives to the search for an enduring democratic legacy for Ghana. It is not for nothing that when our 
forebears established the Ghanaian nation, they chose “Freedom and Justice” as our motto. Our 
generation has to give meaning to this motto. 
On March 6, in a few weeks’ time, Ghana will attain 60 years as an independent nation. I suspect that 
those early nationalists would be disappointed, if they came today and saw the level of development we 
have achieved in 60 years of independence. 
Our journey has had some highs and unfortunately many lows. Since we accepted a consensus on how 
we should be governed with the onset of the Fourth Republic, we have performed more creditably. It is 
within this period of 24 years that Ghana has witnessed a consistent period of development. 
Sixty years after attaining nationhood, we no longer have any excuses for being poor. I stand here today, 
humbled beyond measure for the opportunity to lead this country at this time and take us to a higher 
level in our development. 
The words of JB Danquah, one of the founding fathers of the Ghanaian nation, are compelling. He said 
as far back as 1960 that the duty of government should be “to liberate the energies of the people for the 
growth of a property owning democracy in this land, with right to life, freedom and justice, as the 
principles to which the government and the laws of the land should be dedicated in order specifically to 
enrich life, property and liberty of each and every citizen.” 
We have an exuberant and young, growing population that wants the best of what the world has to 
offer and will not settle for “Third World” or “developing world” standards. We have an adventurous 
people who are in a hurry for success. I have no doubt that the talents, energies, sense of enterprise and 
innovation of the Ghanaian can be harnessed to make Ghana the place where dreams come true.
It took us a while, but the consensus on multi-party constitutional rule has been established, and, for the 
third time, we have had a peaceful transfer of power from a governing party to an opposition one. We 
have done it without any fuss and it is now part of what we do as a people.
Kofi Abrefa Busia, Prime Minister of the Progress Party government of the 2nd Republic, and one of the 
great Ghanaians, said in these eloquent words: “We regard politics as an avenue of service to our fellow 
men. We hold that political power is to be exercised to make life nobler and happier. 
Our success or failure should be judged by the quality of the individual, by his knowledge, his skills, his 
behaviour as a member of society, the standard of living he is able to enjoy and by the degree of 
harmony and brotherliness in our community life as a nation.”
We should move on to deepen our democracy. It is time to make sure that we have a true separation of 
powers between the various arms of government. Our Parliament, the legislative arm of government, 
must grow into its proper role as an effective machinery for accountability and oversight of the 
Executive, and not be its junior partner. 
The Ghanaian Parliament, the Ghanaian Member of Parliament, must stand out as institutions that 
represent all that we hold dear and citizens can take pride in. 
Our judiciary must inspire confidence in the citizens, so we can all see the courts as the ultimate arbitres 
when disputes arise, as they would. A Ghanaian judge must be a reassuring presence and the epitome of 
fairness. 
We have worked with our national constitution for 24 years and we now know the areas that require 
change. I believe a consensus is emerging that we must decentralize more. We must devolve more 
power with corresponding resources to the base of our political system and to our people, in the regions 
and communities. We must trust the individual and collective wisdom and good sense of our people. 
We must restore integrity in public life. State coffers are not spoils for the party that wins an election, 
but resources for the country’s social and economic development. I shall protect the public purse by 
insisting on value-for-money in all public transactions. Public service is just that – service and not an 
avenue for making money. Money is to be made in the private sector, not the public. Measures will be 
put in place to ensure this. 
We must create wealth and restore happiness to our nation. We can only do this when we have an 
educated and skilled population that is capable of competing in the global economy. We must expand 
our horizons and embrace science and technology as critical tools for our development. 
We believe that the business of government is to govern. Ours is to set fair rules. We will provide vision 
and direction and shine the light down the path of our entrepreneurs and farmers. We are, indeed, 
counting on a vibrant private sector to drive growth and create jobs. 
We will stimulate the creative juices of innovators. We will bring back to life the adventurer in you. It is 
time to imagine and to dream again; time to try that business idea again. We will reduce taxes to 
recover the momentum of our economy. The doors of Ghana are open again. The shutters are up again. 
There could not be a better opportunity to “Make in Ghana”, and to make it in Ghana. GHANA IS OPEN 
FOR BUSINESS AGAIN! 
We will build a confident Ghana which is united, at peace with itself and takes pride in its diversity. 
We will rekindle the spirit that made Ghana the leading light on the African continent, and make our 
conditions deserving of that accolade. We will work with our neighbours and friends on the continent to 
enhance peace, democracy and political stability in our part of the world. We will reassert vigorously the 
Pan African vocation to which our nation has been dedicated. Integration of our region and of our 
continent will be a strategic objective of Ghanaian policy.
It will not be easy. We have no illusions whatsoever about the enormity of the task that we face, but I 
know that Ghanaians at home and abroad will rise to the occasion; they always do. 
It will require sacrifice, but it can be done. Others have done it. So can we. Our best days still lie ahead. 
Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Ghanaians have ever been a restless, 
questing, hopeful people. And we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came 
before us. 
The Ghanaian people have summoned the change we celebrate today. They have raised their voices in 
an unmistakable chorus. They have cast their votes without equivocation and have forced the change. 
Now we must do the work the season demands. To that work, I now turn with all the authority of my 
office. I ask the Legislature and Judiciary to join with me. But no President, no Parliament, no 
Government can undertake this mission all by itself. 
Fellow citizens, you must be at the centre of the change. The change we have voted for will have to start 
with each of us as individuals. We can start with little changes in our own individual attitudes and 
practices. The change can and should start now and with us as individuals. 
I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building your 
communities and our nation. Let us work until the work is done. Holy Scripture in Galatians 6:9 says "Let 
us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up." 
I assure you, my fellow citizens, who have entrusted me with this mandate, that I will advance my 
convictions with civility, I will serve the public interest with courage, I will speak for greater justice as 
well as compassion, and I will call for responsibility and I will live it, as well. 
This is my solemn pledge.
I see exciting times ahead. The rule of law will be the underlying tenet of our lives; and the law will be 
applicable to all of us, and not just some. 
We will have to work hard, harder than we have ever done before; and the hard work will be done by all 
of us, and not just some. There will be discipline in all sectors of our lives; and this applies to all of us, 
not just some. 
Our public service will be accorded the dignity and respect it deserves, and be made to attract the bright 
young people it needs. 
We acknowledge there will always be the need for a safety net for the vulnerable in our society, as in all 
other societies. Our nation will work when the marginalised and vulnerable are catered for and treated 
with respect. 
Our elderly people will be recognised for their roles in building Ghana and assured of care in the dusk of 
their lives.
We should all recognise the danger we face by the alarming degradation of our environment and work 
to protect our water bodies, our forests, our lands and the oceans. We should learn and accept that we 
do not own the land, but hold it in trust for generations yet unborn and, therefore, have a responsibility 
to take good care of it and all it contains. 
Ghana’s first President, Kwame Nkrumah, Osagyefo, said at the end of 1957, the year of our 
independence: “We shall measure our progress by the happiness which our people take in being able to 
manage their own affairs.” 
Since March 6, 1957, we all say as a matter of routine that we are Ghanaians. It is time to define what 
being a Ghanaian ought to mean.
Being a Ghanaian must stand for something more than the holder of a birth certificate or a certain 
passport. 
Being a Ghanaian must put certain responsibilities on each one of us. 
Calling yourself a Ghanaian must mean you have signed up to a certain definable code and conduct. 
Being a Ghanaian puts an obligation on each one of us to work at building a fair, prosperous and happy 
nation.
And calling yourself a Ghanaian must mean we look out for each other. 
There should be no higher praise than to be able to say I AM A GHANAIAN. 
I thank the Almighty that I am able to say with pride, I am a Ghanaian. A new dawn has arisen in Ghana, 
which will enable us to build a new Ghanaian civilization which will be the beacon of Africa and the 
wonder of the world. I thank you all, my fellow citizens, for making me the president of this beautiful 
country. 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and may God bless our homeland Ghana and make her great and strong. And 
may God bless us all and Mother Africa.
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC,
NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO, 
AT THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE 2018 WEST AFRICA MINING AND POWER CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION (WAMPOC/WAMPEX) ON WEDNESDAY, 30TH MAY, 2018, AT THE ACCRA INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTRE, ACCRA.

I am very glad to be amongst you this morning, at the opening of the 2018 West African Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition, and to engage with you, leaders of the mining and power sectors of the economy. This event is an important platform to bring together various stakeholders in two of the most prized sectors of our economy, as we work together to chart a path of economic prosperity for our nation.   

Ladies and gentlemen, as we mark the 90th Anniversary of the Chamber of Mines, the theme chosen for this year’s event, “A Responsible and Sustainable Mining Industry, A Partner for National Development” is most opportune. 

For nine decades, the Chamber’s role as a leading business association has been exemplary. The Chamber’s intimate connection with the mining sector has resulted in many partnerships with key state institutions. The Chamber’s reputation, built on the back of nine decades of commitment to upholding the interests of its members, is enviable. I commend the diverse contributions of its member companies to making Ghana’s large-scale mining sector a critical component of our nation’s economic growth.

As I have said on several other occasions, since the Almighty has blessed our land with many minerals, mining has been, and will always be part of the activities that define the Ghanaian people. The challenge we face is not whether we mine or do not mine: it is about how to undertake mining in a sustainable and responsible manner. Mining provides many of us with a source of living, but we all have a collective responsibility to ensuring that mining activities do not leave our lands degraded, and rob future generations of a safe and habitable environment.

There is no question, but that, after all these years, we have not maximized the benefits of mining, and there remains a lot to learn of best practices from other places, so that we can protect the environment and reap maximum reward from the exploitation of our mineral resources.

Some gains have been made; but many challenges remain, and it is time to address them.

The mining sector makes very important contributions to the generation of our country’s revenue. According to the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), except for 2014, in the past six years, the mining sector has provided the largest tax base. But the truth must be told: it is difficult for the average Ghanaian to appreciate that the country gains substantially from mining. It probably has to do with the fact that the communities in which mining has been done remain largely underdeveloped, and do not show signs of being the origins of what brings wealth to so many people and places. For years we were told the mine in Obuasi was the richest gold mine in the world. The question is justifiably asked: how come Obuasi does not show any sign that it is the home of the richest gold mine in the world? The contrast between Obuasi and Johannesburg, for example, is stark and compelling.    

Ladies and gentlemen, as in now well-known, our nation faces a grave difficulty with the activities of illegal miners or galamsayers, as we call them. This is a problem that should be of great concern to the large-scale mining sector, and the Chamber of Mines as well. The rise in illegal mining has, no doubt, been fueled not only by the unemployment problem that has blighted our nation for so long, but also by the unhealthy desire for quick riches. 

There must be a lot of opportunities in the mining sector to help with the unemployment of our youth. I refer, in particular, to our “One-District-One-Factory” programme as an avenue through which we can enter the value chain addition of the mining industry. A large amount of spending by mining companies leaks from the domestic economy through the importation of several tools and equipment, which Ghana has the capacity to produce. It is time to reverse this trend. Ghanaian entrepreneurs must be encouraged to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Chamber to identify opportunities in the value chain, where indigenous companies can manufacture these products locally. 

I know that mining inputs, such as caustic soda, activated carbon and grinding media, can be produced locally if businesses produce at competitive prices, in the needed quantities and the right quality. The readily available raw materials for some of the inputs mean that there is great potential for interested investors. This is your sector. I should not be enumerating the details for you. It is enough to say that it is time to produce locally many of the inputs that you currently import. The mining sector ought to be a captive market for the 1D-1F initiative. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Ghana has been touted as one of the countries with the fastest growth potential in the coming years. This growth, according to a study by the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), is based largely on the strong performance of the extractives sector. The mining extractive sector, however, is no longer a large employer of labour due to improvement in the deployment of technology and innovation. We must necessarily, therefore, stimulate job creation in an integrated manner through the value chain of the extractives sector.

The extractives sector, particularly mining, can help rapidly to grow our manufacturing sector. Government is empowering the private sector to create jobs and wealth by working closely with industry and academia to equip young professionals with the skills required to operate competitively in the sector. 

We are establishing a new paradigm of an integrated mining industry to propel local manufacturing. The value chain of mining has huge potential for job-creation, and we intend to tap into it to develop our economy. We cannot, and should not continue to be merely exporters of raw materials to other countries. I call on all players in the sector to work with us to deepen the integration of the mining sector with the non-mineral sectors of the economy.

Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my remarks, I made reference to the state of mining communities in our country. Why is Obuasi not the most beautiful city in Ghana or the world, if it hosts the richest gold mine; why do Tarkwa and Prestea not look like the golden towns they are, and why does Akwatia’s appearance not reflect anything about the diamonds that have been taken from its soils all these years? The distressed state of communities in which mining companies operate is nothing short of a disgrace, and we must work to change the situation. Even though mining companies have, over the years, complemented the work of government in these communities, I am certain that a lot more can be done to transform the communities if government and the mining companies collaborate in an intelligent and sustainable manner.

The Minerals Development Fund Act (2016), Act 912, was enacted to address some of these problems, and my government is working to ensure that the Act is fully operational to provide financial resources to transform mining communities. We are aware that the delay, in rolling out structures for operationalizing the MDF Act, is affecting development in mining communities and, indeed, the way in which mining is viewed in some sections of the community at large. Let me assure you that the MDF Act will be functional very soon to serve as the vehicle for development in the host communities. The Board of Trustees of the Minerals Development Fund will also be inaugurated shortly to enable it to play its expected governance role under the Minerals Development Fund Act. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I am looking forward to the implementation of the National Assay Programme. This should remove all doubts and set everybody’s mind at ease regarding the volume and value of gold legitimately exported by the sector, particularly by gold producing members of the Chamber. This is an exercise which is long overdue, and has mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders.

That is why I commend the Chamber and the mining companies for the decision to work with the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), which has been appointed as the national assayer, to assay all bullion being exported out of the country for both small scale and large-scale mining companies. Even though the PMMC does not presently have the requisite technology to be fully operational, they now have a strong incentive to build their capacity and transform their operations. I am confident they will do so expeditiously.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is well-known that power is critical to industry in general, and, especially so, for an energy intensive sector such as the mining sector. The triple elements of the requirements of an adequate, reliable and cost-effective power supply are fundamental to success across all sectors of industry. We need reliable and cost competitive power supply to be able to translate into reality our desire for harnessing linkage opportunities and value addition to our gold, bauxite, iron ore and other minerals. 

We must salute the PURC for implementing a 10% reduction in power tariffs a few months ago for the mining companies, as government had requested, and urge them to work to find scope for further reduction to help stimulate industry.

It is our desire to review continually the energy mix, and cost of power generation for competitive cost-effective power tariffs. A concentration on cost competitive generation and transmission of power should allow us to trade excess power under the West Africa Power Pool within the ECOWAS Region.

Ladies and gentlemen, mining invariably involves interference with the landscape and, unless great care is taken, it usually means serious degradation of the lands and water bodies. We have had to take the very tough decision to place a ban on all small-scale mining, because of the alarming destruction of our environment. The ban is meant to be a temporary measure, until we are able to streamline and regulate the small-scale mining sector. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, led by its dynamic Minister, John Peter Amewu, has worked on the Multi-Sectoral Mining Integrated Project (MMIP) to provide the needed framework to streamline small scale mining, and provide avenues for alternative employment for the galamseyers. I am aware that the Chamber made inputs to the production of the MMIP, which were very welcome. 

It must be said that the degradation of the environment in mining is not done only by illegal or small-scale miners. Large-scale mining companies have also been known to flout the rules, and degrade and, sometimes, pollute our water bodies. It is, therefore, essential that we quickly strengthen the regulatory institutions so that they can vigorously enforce environmental, health and safety laws to protect our people, our ecology and our future. 
As you will recall, I made a pledge of an annual contribution of five million Ghana cedis towards the construction of the new campus at Wassa Fiase of the George Grant University of Mines and Technology (GGUMaT), during the investiture of the 2nd President of the 4th Republic, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, as its Chancellor. Being the primary tertiary institution that trains technical human resources for the mining industry, it is expected, as happens in other jurisdictions, that the mining sector will be at the forefront of supporting this University. I appeal to the members of the Chamber to commit to supporting this all important University through their corporate social investment initiatives.

Let me, in concluding, commend, again, the leadership of the Chamber and the organisers of the West Africa Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition for putting together such a worthwhile event. As President of the Republic, it is my duty and desire actively to promote responsible and sustainable mining for the good of generations yet unborn.

I wish you happy and fruitful interactions and deliberations, and I now formally declare the West Africa Mining and Power Conference open, and the Exhibition duly launched.

May God bless us, and all the peoples of West Africa, and make our Region great and strong. Thank you for your attention.

This should remove all doubts and set everybody’s mind at ease regarding the volume and value of gold legitimately exported by the sector, particularly by gold producing members of the Chamber. This is an exercise which is long overdue, and has mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders.

That is why I commend the Chamber and the mining companies for the decision to work with the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), which has been appointed as the national assayer, to assay all bullion being exported out of the country for both small scale and large-scale mining companies. Even though the PMMC does not presently have the requisite technology to be fully operational, they now have a strong incentive to build their capacity and transform their operations. I am confident they will do so expeditiously.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is well-known that power is critical to industry in general, and, especially so, for an energy intensive sector such as the mining sector. The triple elements of the requirements of an adequate, reliable and cost-effective power supply are fundamental to success across all sectors of industry. We need reliable and cost competitive power supply to be able to translate into reality our desire for harnessing linkage opportunities and value addition to our gold, bauxite, iron ore and other minerals. 

We must salute the PURC for implementing a 10% reduction in power tariffs a few months ago for the mining companies, as government had requested, and urge them to work to find scope for further reduction to help stimulate industry.

It is our desire to review continually the energy mix, and cost of power generation for competitive cost-effective power tariffs. A concentration on cost competitive generation and transmission of power should allow us to trade excess power under the West Africa Power Pool within the ECOWAS Region.

Ladies and gentlemen, mining invariably involves interference with the landscape and, unless great care is taken, it usually means serious degradation of the lands and water bodies. We have had to take the very tough decision to place a ban on all small-scale mining, because of the alarming destruction of our environment. The ban is meant to be a temporary measure, until we are able to streamline and regulate the small-scale mining sector. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, led by its dynamic Minister, John Peter Amewu, has worked on the Multi-Sectoral Mining Integrated Project (MMIP) to provide the needed framework to streamline small scale mining, and provide avenues for alternative employment for the galamseyers. I am aware that the Chamber made inputs to the production of the MMIP, which were very welcome. 

It must be said that the degradation of the environment in mining is not done only by illegal or small-scale miners. Large-scale mining companies have also been known to flout the rules, and degrade and, sometimes, pollute our water bodies. It is, therefore, essential that we quickly strengthen the regulatory institutions so that they can vigorously enforce environmental, health and safety laws to protect our people, our ecology and our future. 
As you will recall, I made a pledge of an annual contribution of five million Ghana cedis towards the construction of the new campus at Wassa Fiase of the George Grant University of Mines and Technology (GGUMaT), during the investiture of the 2nd President of the 4th Republic, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, as its Chancellor. Being the primary tertiary institution that trains technical human resources for the mining industry, it is expected, as happens in other jurisdictions, that the mining sector will be at the forefront of supporting this University. I appeal to the members of the Chamber to commit to supporting this all important University through their corporate social investment initiatives.

Let me, in concluding, commend, again, the leadership of the Chamber and the organisers of the West Africa Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition for putting together such a worthwhile event. As President of the Republic, it is my duty and desire actively to promote responsible and sustainable mining for the good of generations yet unborn.

I wish you happy and fruitful interactions and deliberations, and I now formally declare the West Africa Mining and Power Conference open, and the Exhibition duly launched.

May God bless us, and all the peoples of West Africa, and make our Region great and strong. Thank you for your attention.

I am very glad to be amongst you this morning, at the opening of the 2018 West African Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition, and to engage with you, leaders of the mining and power sectors of the economy. This event is an important platform to bring together various stakeholders in two of the most prized sectors of our economy, as we work together to chart a path of economic prosperity for our nation.   

Ladies and gentlemen, as we mark the 90th Anniversary of the Chamber of Mines, the theme chosen for this year’s event, “A Responsible and Sustainable Mining Industry, A Partner for National Development” is most opportune. 

For nine decades, the Chamber’s role as a leading business association has been exemplary. The Chamber’s intimate connection with the mining sector has resulted in many partnerships with key state institutions. The Chamber’s reputation, built on the back of nine decades of commitment to upholding the interests of its members, is enviable. I commend the diverse contributions of its member companies to making Ghana’s large-scale mining sector a critical component of our nation’s economic growth.

As I have said on several other occasions, since the Almighty has blessed our land with many minerals, mining has been, and will always be part of the activities that define the Ghanaian people. The challenge we face is not whether we mine or do not mine: it is about how to undertake mining in a sustainable and responsible manner. Mining provides many of us with a source of living, but we all have a collective responsibility to ensuring that mining activities do not leave our lands degraded, and rob future generations of a safe and habitable environment.

There is no question, but that, after all these years, we have not maximized the benefits of mining, and there remains a lot to learn of best practices from other places, so that we can protect the environment and reap maximum reward from the exploitation of our mineral resources.

Some gains have been made; but many challenges remain, and it is time to address them.

The mining sector makes very important contributions to the generation of our country’s revenue. According to the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), except for 2014, in the past six years, the mining sector has provided the largest tax base. But the truth must be told: it is difficult for the average Ghanaian to appreciate that the country gains substantially from mining. It probably has to do with the fact that the communities in which mining has been done remain largely underdeveloped, and do not show signs of being the origins of what brings wealth to so many people and places. For years we were told the mine in Obuasi was the richest gold mine in the world. The question is justifiably asked: how come Obuasi does not show any sign that it is the home of the richest gold mine in the world? The contrast between Obuasi and Johannesburg, for example, is stark and compelling.    

Ladies and gentlemen, as in now well-known, our nation faces a grave difficulty with the activities of illegal miners or galamsayers, as we call them. This is a problem that should be of great concern to the large-scale mining sector, and the Chamber of Mines as well. The rise in illegal mining has, no doubt, been fueled not only by the unemployment problem that has blighted our nation for so long, but also by the unhealthy desire for quick riches. 

There must be a lot of opportunities in the mining sector to help with the unemployment of our youth. I refer, in particular, to our “One-District-One-Factory” programme as an avenue through which we can enter the value chain addition of the mining industry. A large amount of spending by mining companies leaks from the domestic economy through the importation of several tools and equipment, which Ghana has the capacity to produce. It is time to reverse this trend. Ghanaian entrepreneurs must be encouraged to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Chamber to identify opportunities in the value chain, where indigenous companies can manufacture these products locally. 

I know that mining inputs, such as caustic soda, activated carbon and grinding media, can be produced locally if businesses produce at competitive prices, in the needed quantities and the right quality. The readily available raw materials for some of the inputs mean that there is great potential for interested investors. This is your sector. I should not be enumerating the details for you. It is enough to say that it is time to produce locally many of the inputs that you currently import. The mining sector ought to be a captive market for the 1D-1F initiative. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Ghana has been touted as one of the countries with the fastest growth potential in the coming years. This growth, according to a study by the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), is based largely on the strong performance of the extractives sector. The mining extractive sector, however, is no longer a large employer of labour due to improvement in the deployment of technology and innovation. We must necessarily, therefore, stimulate job creation in an integrated manner through the value chain of the extractives sector.

The extractives sector, particularly mining, can help rapidly to grow our manufacturing sector. Government is empowering the private sector to create jobs and wealth by working closely with industry and academia to equip young professionals with the skills required to operate competitively in the sector. 

We are establishing a new paradigm of an integrated mining industry to propel local manufacturing. The value chain of mining has huge potential for job-creation, and we intend to tap into it to develop our economy. We cannot, and should not continue to be merely exporters of raw materials to other countries. I call on all players in the sector to work with us to deepen the integration of the mining sector with the non-mineral sectors of the economy.

Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my remarks, I made reference to the state of mining communities in our country. Why is Obuasi not the most beautiful city in Ghana or the world, if it hosts the richest gold mine; why do Tarkwa and Prestea not look like the golden towns they are, and why does Akwatia’s appearance not reflect anything about the diamonds that have been taken from its soils all these years? The distressed state of communities in which mining companies operate is nothing short of a disgrace, and we must work to change the situation. Even though mining companies have, over the years, complemented the work of government in these communities, I am certain that a lot more can be done to transform the communities if government and the mining companies collaborate in an intelligent and sustainable manner.

The Minerals Development Fund Act (2016), Act 912, was enacted to address some of these problems, and my government is working to ensure that the Act is fully operational to provide financial resources to transform mining communities. We are aware that the delay, in rolling out structures for operationalizing the MDF Act, is affecting development in mining communities and, indeed, the way in which mining is viewed in some sections of the community at large. Let me assure you that the MDF Act will be functional very soon to serve as the vehicle for development in the host communities. The Board of Trustees of the Minerals Development Fund will also be inaugurated shortly to enable it to play its expected governance role under the Minerals Development Fund Act.

Ladies and gentlemen, mining invariably involves interference with the landscape and, unless great care is taken, it usually means serious degradation of the lands and water bodies. We have had to take the very tough decision to place a ban on all small-scale mining, because of the alarming destruction of our environment. The ban is meant to be a temporary measure, until we are able to streamline and regulate the small-scale mining sector. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, led by its dynamic Minister, John Peter Amewu, has worked on the Multi-Sectoral Mining Integrated Project (MMIP) to provide the needed framework to streamline small scale mining, and provide avenues for alternative employment for the galamseyers. I am aware that the Chamber made inputs to the production of the MMIP, which were very welcome. 

It must be said that the degradation of the environment in mining is not done only by illegal or small-scale miners. Large-scale mining companies have also been known to flout the rules, and degrade and, sometimes, pollute our water bodies. It is, therefore, essential that we quickly strengthen the regulatory institutions so that they can vigorously enforce environmental, health and safety laws to protect our people, our ecology and our future. 
As you will recall, I made a pledge of an annual contribution of five million Ghana cedis towards the construction of the new campus at Wassa Fiase of the George Grant University of Mines and Technology (GGUMaT), during the investiture of the 2nd President of the 4th Republic, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, as its Chancellor. Being the primary tertiary institution that trains technical human resources for the mining industry, it is expected, as happens in other jurisdictions, that the mining sector will be at the forefront of supporting this University. I appeal to the members of the Chamber to commit to supporting this all important University through their corporate social investment initiatives.

Let me, in concluding, commend, again, the leadership of the Chamber and the organisers of the West Africa Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition for putting together such a worthwhile event. As President of the Republic, it is my duty and desire actively to promote responsible and sustainable mining for the good of generations yet unborn.

I wish you happy and fruitful interactions and deliberations, and I now formally declare the West Africa Mining and Power Conference open, and the Exhibition duly launched.

May God bless us, and all the peoples of West Africa, and make our Region great and strong. Thank you for your attention.

I am very glad to be amongst you this morning, at the opening of the 2018 West African Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition, and to engage with you, leaders of the mining and power sectors of the economy. This event is an important platform to bring together various stakeholders in two of the most prized sectors of our economy, as we work together to chart a path of economic prosperity for our nation.   

Ladies and gentlemen, as we mark the 90th Anniversary of the Chamber of Mines, the theme chosen for this year’s event, “A Responsible and Sustainable Mining Industry, A Partner for National Development” is most opportune. 

For nine decades, the Chamber’s role as a leading business association has been exemplary. The Chamber’s intimate connection with the mining sector has resulted in many partnerships with key state institutions. The Chamber’s reputation, built on the back of nine decades of commitment to upholding the interests of its members, is enviable. I commend the diverse contributions of its member companies to making Ghana’s large-scale mining sector a critical component of our nation’s economic growth.

As I have said on several other occasions, since the Almighty has blessed our land with many minerals, mining has been, and will always be part of the activities that define the Ghanaian people. The challenge we face is not whether we mine or do not mine: it is about how to undertake mining in a sustainable and responsible manner. Mining provides many of us with a source of living, but we all have a collective responsibility to ensuring that mining activities do not leave our lands degraded, and rob future generations of a safe and habitable environment.

There is no question, but that, after all these years, we have not maximized the benefits of mining, and there remains a lot to learn of best practices from other places, so that we can protect the environment and reap maximum reward from the exploitation of our mineral resources.

Some gains have been made; but many challenges remain, and it is time to address them.

The mining sector makes very important contributions to the generation of our country’s revenue. According to the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), except for 2014, in the past six years, the mining sector has provided the largest tax base. But the truth must be told: it is difficult for the average Ghanaian to appreciate that the country gains substantially from mining. It probably has to do with the fact that the communities in which mining has been done remain largely underdeveloped, and do not show signs of being the origins of what brings wealth to so many people and places. For years we were told the mine in Obuasi was the richest gold mine in the world. The question is justifiably asked: how come Obuasi does not show any sign that it is the home of the richest gold mine in the world? The contrast between Obuasi and Johannesburg, for example, is stark and compelling.    

Ladies and gentlemen, as in now well-known, our nation faces a grave difficulty with the activities of illegal miners or galamsayers, as we call them. This is a problem that should be of great concern to the large-scale mining sector, and the Chamber of Mines as well. The rise in illegal mining has, no doubt, been fueled not only by the unemployment problem that has blighted our nation for so long, but also by the unhealthy desire for quick riches. 

There must be a lot of opportunities in the mining sector to help with the unemployment of our youth. I refer, in particular, to our “One-District-One-Factory” programme as an avenue through which we can enter the value chain addition of the mining industry. A large amount of spending by mining companies leaks from the domestic economy through the importation of several tools and equipment, which Ghana has the capacity to produce. It is time to reverse this trend. Ghanaian entrepreneurs must be encouraged to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Chamber to identify opportunities in the value chain, where indigenous companies can manufacture these products locally. 

I know that mining inputs, such as caustic soda, activated carbon and grinding media, can be produced locally if businesses produce at competitive prices, in the needed quantities and the right quality. The readily available raw materials for some of the inputs mean that there is great potential for interested investors. This is your sector. I should not be enumerating the details for you. It is enough to say that it is time to produce locally many of the inputs that you currently import. The mining sector ought to be a captive market for the 1D-1F initiative. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Ghana has been touted as one of the countries with the fastest growth potential in the coming years. This growth, according to a study by the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), is based largely on the strong performance of the extractives sector. The mining extractive sector, however, is no longer a large employer of labour due to improvement in the deployment of technology and innovation. We must necessarily, therefore, stimulate job creation in an integrated manner through the value chain of the extractives sector.

The extractives sector, particularly mining, can help rapidly to grow our manufacturing sector. Government is empowering the private sector to create jobs and wealth by working closely with industry and academia to equip young professionals with the skills required to operate competitively in the sector. 

We are establishing a new paradigm of an integrated mining industry to propel local manufacturing. The value chain of mining has huge potential for job-creation, and we intend to tap into it to develop our economy. We cannot, and should not continue to be merely exporters of raw materials to other countries. I call on all players in the sector to work with us to deepen the integration of the mining sector with the non-mineral sectors of the economy.

Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my remarks, I made reference to the state of mining communities in our country. Why is Obuasi not the most beautiful city in Ghana or the world, if it hosts the richest gold mine; why do Tarkwa and Prestea not look like the golden towns they are, and why does Akwatia’s appearance not reflect anything about the diamonds that have been taken from its soils all these years? The distressed state of communities in which mining companies operate is nothing short of a disgrace, and we must work to change the situation. Even though mining companies have, over the years, complemented the work of government in these communities, I am certain that a lot more can be done to transform the communities if government and the mining companies collaborate in an intelligent and sustainable manner.

The Minerals Development Fund Act (2016), Act 912, was enacted to address some of these problems, and my government is working to ensure that the Act is fully operational to provide financial resources to transform mining communities. We are aware that the delay, in rolling out structures for operationalizing the MDF Act, is affecting development in mining communities and, indeed, the way in which mining is viewed in some sections of the community at large. Let me assure you that the MDF Act will be functional very soon to serve as the vehicle for development in the host communities. The Board of Trustees of the Minerals Development Fund will also be inaugurated shortly to enable it to play its expected governance role under the Minerals Development Fund Act. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I am looking forward to the implementation of the National Assay Programme. This should remove all doubts and set everybody’s mind at ease regarding the volume and value of gold legitimately exported by the sector, particularly by gold producing members of the Chamber. This is an exercise which is long overdue, and has mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders.

That is why I commend the Chamber and the mining companies for the decision to work with the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), which has been appointed as the national assayer, to assay all bullion being exported out of the country for both small scale and large-scale mining companies. Even though the PMMC does not presently have the requisite technology to be fully operational, they now have a strong incentive to build their capacity and transform their operations. I am confident they will do so expeditiously.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is well-known that power is critical to industry in general, and, especially so, for an energy intensive sector such as the mining sector. The triple elements of the requirements of an adequate, reliable and cost-effective power supply are fundamental to success across all sectors of industry. We need reliable and cost competitive power supply to be able to translate into reality our desire for harnessing linkage opportunities and value addition to our gold, bauxite, iron ore and other minerals. 

We must salute the PURC for implementing a 10% reduction in power tariffs a few months ago for the mining companies, as government had requested, and urge them to work to find scope for further reduction to help stimulate industry.

It is our desire to review continually the energy mix, and cost of power generation for competitive cost-effective power tariffs. A concentration on cost competitive generation and transmission of power should allow us to trade excess power under the West Africa Power Pool within the ECOWAS Region.

I appeal to the members of the Chamber to commit to supporting this all important University through their corporate social investment initiatives.

Let me, in concluding, commend, again, the leadership of the Chamber and the organisers of the West Africa Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition for putting together such a worthwhile event. As President of the Republic, it is my duty and desire actively to promote responsible and sustainable mining for the good of generations yet unborn.

I wish you happy and fruitful interactions and deliberations, and I now formally declare the West Africa Mining and Power Conference open, and the Exhibition duly launched.

May God bless us, and all the peoples of West Africa, and make our Region great and strong. Thank you for your attention.

I am very glad to be amongst you this morning, at the opening of the 2018 West African Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition, and to engage with you, leaders of the mining and power sectors of the economy. This event is an important platform to bring together various stakeholders in two of the most prized sectors of our economy, as we work together to chart a path of economic prosperity for our nation.   

Ladies and gentlemen, as we mark the 90th Anniversary of the Chamber of Mines, the theme chosen for this year’s event, “A Responsible and Sustainable Mining Industry, A Partner for National Development” is most opportune. 

For nine decades, the Chamber’s role as a leading business association has been exemplary. The Chamber’s intimate connection with the mining sector has resulted in many partnerships with key state institutions. The Chamber’s reputation, built on the back of nine decades of commitment to upholding the interests of its members, is enviable. I commend the diverse contributions of its member companies to making Ghana’s large-scale mining sector a critical component of our nation’s economic growth.

As I have said on several other occasions, since the Almighty has blessed our land with many minerals, mining has been, and will always be part of the activities that define the Ghanaian people. The challenge we face is not whether we mine or do not mine: it is about how to undertake mining in a sustainable and responsible manner. Mining provides many of us with a source of living, but we all have a collective responsibility to ensuring that mining activities do not leave our lands degraded, and rob future generations of a safe and habitable environment.

There is no question, but that, after all these years, we have not maximized the benefits of mining, and there remains a lot to learn of best practices from other places, so that we can protect the environment and reap maximum reward from the exploitation of our mineral resources.

Some gains have been made; but many challenges remain, and it is time to address them.

The mining sector makes very important contributions to the generation of our country’s revenue. According to the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), except for 2014, in the past six years, the mining sector has provided the largest tax base. But the truth must be told: it is difficult for the average Ghanaian to appreciate that the country gains substantially from mining. It probably has to do with the fact that the communities in which mining has been done remain largely underdeveloped, and do not show signs of being the origins of what brings wealth to so many people and places. For years we were told the mine in Obuasi was the richest gold mine in the world. The question is justifiably asked: how come Obuasi does not show any sign that it is the home of the richest gold mine in the world? The contrast between Obuasi and Johannesburg, for example, is stark and compelling.    

Ladies and gentlemen, as in now well-known, our nation faces a grave difficulty with the activities of illegal miners or galamsayers, as we call them. This is a problem that should be of great concern to the large-scale mining sector, and the Chamber of Mines as well. The rise in illegal mining has, no doubt, been fueled not only by the unemployment problem that has blighted our nation for so long, but also by the unhealthy desire for quick riches. 

There must be a lot of opportunities in the mining sector to help with the unemployment of our youth. I refer, in particular, to our “One-District-One-Factory” programme as an avenue through which we can enter the value chain addition of the mining industry. A large amount of spending by mining companies leaks from the domestic economy through the importation of several tools and equipment, which Ghana has the capacity to produce. It is time to reverse this trend. Ghanaian entrepreneurs must be encouraged to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Chamber to identify opportunities in the value chain, where indigenous companies can manufacture these products locally. 

I know that mining inputs, such as caustic soda, activated carbon and grinding media, can be produced locally if businesses produce at competitive prices, in the needed quantities and the right quality. The readily available raw materials for some of the inputs mean that there is great potential for interested investors. This is your sector. I should not be enumerating the details for you. It is enough to say that it is time to produce locally many of the inputs that you currently import. The mining sector ought to be a captive market for the 1D-1F initiative. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Ghana has been touted as one of the countries with the fastest growth potential in the coming years. This growth, according to a study by the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), is based largely on the strong performance of the extractives sector. The mining extractive sector, however, is no longer a large employer of labour due to improvement in the deployment of technology and innovation. We must necessarily, therefore, stimulate job creation in an integrated manner through the value chain of the extractives sector.

The extractives sector, particularly mining, can help rapidly to grow our manufacturing sector. Government is empowering the private sector to create jobs and wealth by working closely with industry and academia to equip young professionals with the skills required to operate competitively in the sector. 

We are establishing a new paradigm of an integrated mining industry to propel local manufacturing. The value chain of mining has huge potential for job-creation, and we intend to tap into it to develop our economy. We cannot, and should not continue to be merely exporters of raw materials to other countries. I call on all players in the sector to work with us to deepen the integration of the mining sector with the non-mineral sectors of the economy.

Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my remarks, I made reference to the state of mining communities in our country. Why is Obuasi not the most beautiful city in Ghana or the world, if it hosts the richest gold mine; why do Tarkwa and Prestea not look like the golden towns they are, and why does Akwatia’s appearance not reflect anything about the diamonds that have been taken from its soils all these years? The distressed state of communities in which mining companies operate is nothing short of a disgrace, and we must work to change the situation. Even though mining companies have, over the years, complemented the work of government in these communities, I am certain that a lot more can be done to transform the communities if government and the mining companies collaborate in an intelligent and sustainable manner.

The Minerals Development Fund Act (2016), Act 912, was enacted to address some of these problems, and my government is working to ensure that the Act is fully operational to provide financial resources to transform mining communities. We are aware that the delay, in rolling out structures for operationalizing the MDF Act, is affecting development in mining communities and, indeed, the way in which mining is viewed in some sections of the community at large. Let me assure you that the MDF Act will be functional very soon to serve as the vehicle for development in the host communities. The Board of Trustees of the Minerals Development Fund will also be inaugurated shortly to enable it to play its expected governance role under the Minerals Development Fund Act. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I am looking forward to the implementation of the National Assay Programme. This should remove all doubts and set everybody’s mind at ease regarding the volume and value of gold legitimately exported by the sector, particularly by gold producing members of the Chamber. This is an exercise which is long overdue, and has mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders.

That is why I commend the Chamber and the mining companies for the decision to work with the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), which has been appointed as the national assayer, to assay all bullion being exported out of the country for both small scale and large-scale mining companies. Even though the PMMC does not presently have the requisite technology to be fully operational, they now have a strong incentive to build their capacity and transform their operations. I am confident they will do so expeditiously.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is well-known that power is critical to industry in general, and, especially so, for an energy intensive sector such as the mining sector. The triple elements of the requirements of an adequate, reliable and cost-effective power supply are fundamental to success across all sectors of industry. We need reliable and cost competitive power supply to be able to translate into reality our desire for harnessing linkage opportunities and value addition to our gold, bauxite, iron ore and other minerals. 

We must salute the PURC for implementing a 10% reduction in power tariffs a few months ago for the mining companies, as government had requested, and urge them to work to find scope for further reduction to help stimulate industry.

It is our desire to review continually the energy mix, and cost of power generation for competitive cost-effective power tariffs. A concentration on cost competitive generation and transmission of power should allow us to trade excess power under the West Africa Power Pool within the ECOWAS Region.

Ladies and gentlemen, mining invariably involves interference with the landscape and, unless great care is taken, it usually means serious degradation of the lands and water bodies. We have had to take the very tough decision to place a ban on all small-scale mining, because of the alarming destruction of our environment. The ban is meant to be a temporary measure, until we are able to streamline and regulate the small-scale mining sector. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, led by its dynamic Minister, John Peter Amewu, has worked on the Multi-Sectoral Mining Integrated Project (MMIP) to provide the needed framework to streamline small scale mining, and provide avenues for alternative employment for the galamseyers. I am aware that the Chamber made inputs to the production of the MMIP, which were very welcome. 

It must be said that the degradation of the environment in mining is not done only by illegal or small-scale miners. Large-scale mining companies have also been known to flout the rules, and degrade and, sometimes, pollute our water bodies. It is, therefore, essential that we quickly strengthen the regulatory institutions so that they can vigorously enforce environmental, health and safety laws to protect our people, our ecology and our future. 
As you will recall, I made a pledge of an annual contribution of five million Ghana cedis towards the construction of the new campus at Wassa Fiase of the George Grant University of Mines and Technology (GGUMaT), during the investiture of the 2nd President of the 4th Republic, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, as its Chancellor.

Parliament will in the coming days receive Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in the Chamber, to discharge his constitutional assignment to update Ghanaians on the state of affairs in the country.
While the President prepares to deliver the 2020 State of the Nation Address (SoNA) on Thursday, February 20,  recaps what he told the nation in on February 8, 2018.
MESSAGE ON THE STATE OF THE NATION DELIVERED BY PRESIDENT NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO

Mr Speaker,
I am happy to be here again in this august House, a place where I have experienced some of the most memorable moments of my political career, and made some cherished friendships across the political divide. I am glad too that, in accordance with protocol and convention, First Lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, Second Lady Samira Bawumia, Chief Justice Sophia Akuffo, and the Justices of the Supreme Court, Chairperson Nana Otuo Siriboe II, and Members of the Council of State, Chief of Defence Staff Lt. Gen O.B. Akwa, Inspector General of Police David Asante Apeatu, and the Service Chiefs, are all present. Mr. Speaker, the House is duly honoured by the welcome attendance of the former Presidents of the Republic, their Excellencies Jerry John Rawlings, John Agyekum Kufuor and John Dramani Mahama, His Excellency the former Vice President of the Republic, Paa Kwasi Amissah-Arthur, and former First Lady, Her Excellency Nana Konadu Agyemang Rawlings.
A year ago, I came as our newly-elected President into a House, where everybody was trying to get used to new positions. There was a large number of fresh entrants, trying to find their feet as the new honourable members. There were the hitherto Minority members, trying to get used to being members of the Majority, and, then, there were the former members of the Majority, trying to get used to their new role as members of the Minority. The House had a new Speaker, who was beginning to fit seamlessly into his new role.
A year later, we can safely say that none of us now turns round in surprise, when addressed by our new titles. We are all used to the reality, made possible by the expression of the free will of the Ghanaian people on December 7, 2016.
Mr Speaker, at the beginning of each session of Parliament, the President has a duty to come to this House, as I have done today, to satisfy the constitutional requirement of delivering to Parliament a Message on the State of the Nation, that is to report on how our nation is faring after this year of change, and to share the prospects we can look forward to in the year ahead.
I would like to start by expressing my sincere gratitude to the House. When I told you I was in a hurry, you promptly rose to the challenge. YouÂ  Â assisted me to appoint my excellent team of ministers, and constitute the government, in record time. I understand that, since the inception of the 4Â Republic, this, the 7, has been the busiest Parliament. You have had 140 days of sittings, and I am told no Parliament, in its first session, has done more than 130 days. This is to the collective credit of members on both sides of the House and your respective leaderships, with the backing of the Right Honourable Speaker and his Deputies.
In the process, this Parliament has passed a number of bills relating to my flagship programmes. Again, I am told it is a first in the 4Â Republic that flagship programmes, and, in this case, as many as five, have been passed in the first year of the government.
I am grateful, and look forward to our continuing to work together to make our nation, Ghana, great and strong.
Mr Speaker, I believe that last year, when I came to the House, I conveyed my dismay at the full extent of the economic mess, in which our nation was mired. We had inherited an economy that was in distress, choked by debt, and with macroeconomic fundamentals in disarray.
You would recall, Mr Speaker, that I said â€œwe would have to implement some tough, prudent and innovative policies to get us out of the financial cul de sac we were inâ€. I made some brave predictions. I said we would â€œreduce significantly the budget deficitâ€, and I said that, at the same time, we would grow and expand the economy.
I am glad to be able to report that the Economic Management Team, under the stellar leadership of the strong, brilliant economist, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, has risen to the challenge, and the hard work is beginning to show positive results.
We have reduced taxes, we are bringing down inflation and interest rates, economic growth is increasing, from the alarming 3.6% at December 2016, to 7.9% in our first year, and the indications are that it will be even better this year. We have increased our international reserves, maintained relative exchange rate stability, reduced the debt to GDP ratio and the rate of debt accumulation, we have paid almost half of arrears inherited, and, crucially,Â we are current on obligations to statutory funds. I am also pleased to report that the 3-year IMF-supported Extended Credit Facility Programme, begun in 2015, comes to an end this year. The relatively good macroeconomic performance in 2017 will strongly support our successful completion of the IMF programme. We are determined to put in place measures to ensure irreversibility, and sustain macroeconomic stability, so that we will have no reason to seek again the assistance of that powerful global body.
Mr. Speaker, we have restored teacher and nursing training allowances. We have doubled the capitation grant, and, to confound the sceptics and professional naysayers, we have implemented Free Senior High School education. It has enabled 90,000 more students gain access to Senior High School education, in 2017, than in 2016. Mr Speaker, we have, nevertheless, been able to meet my promise made last year to the House, and reduced the fiscal deficit from 9.3%, to an estimated 5.6% of GDP.
As I promised, our economists have found imaginative ways to deal with the oppressive debt situation. This has brought some relief, and the annual average rate of debt accumulation, which, in recent years, has been as high as 36%, has declined to 13.6%, as at September 2017. As a result, the public debt stock as a ratio of GDP is 68.3%, against the annual target of 71% for 2017, and end 2016 actual figure of 73.1%. As a result of appropriate policy, and the normalisation of the power situation in the country, they have also engineered a spectacular revival of Ghanaian industry, from a growth rate of -0.5% in 2016 to 17.7% in 2017.
Mr Speaker, I do not suggest, in any way, that these headline-grabbing figures mean we are anywhere near resolving our economic problems. I am saying, to borrow the language of the economists, that, for the first time in a long while, our macroeconomic fundamentals are solid, and all the critical indices are pointing in the right direction.
And the world is taking notice of Ghanaâ€™s economic strides. Earlier, in January, the World Bank stated that Ghanaâ€™s economy would probably grow by 8.3% this year, which would make it the fastest growing economy in the world.
And, then, last week, Bloomberg described Ghanaâ€™s Stock Exchange as the best-performing Stock Exchange in the world for January 2018. The report illustrated how the Ghana Stock Exchange Composite Index has gained 19% since the start of the year, in dollar terms, ahead of the Nigerian, Chinese and Brazilian Stock Markets. Ken Ofori-Atta, the Finance Minister, is proving to be a national asset.
I know that, when it comes to the economy, many of us have very low tolerance for what we consider as boring figures, and we do not see that they affect the reality of our everyday lives. But, as I said earlier in the year, this current set of boring figures happens to spell good news for our economy.
There are figures that the most innumerate among us can relate to, and which can hardly be described as boring. I refer to the figures that emerge when you look at the difference between sole sourcing of government procurement and opening it to tender.
In 2016, the Public Procurement Authority had 622Â Sole Source Requests. Five hundred and ninety-sevenÂ of that number, 98%, were approved, and there were 25 Rejections. There were 592Â Requests made for Restricted Tenders, and 587 (99.15%) were approved, and there were five Rejections. A grand total of zero savings was made.
In 2017, my first year in office, three hundred and 394Â Sole Sourcing Requests were made, out of which 223Â (56.6%) were approved, and 171Â (43.4%) rejected. There were 346Â Requests for Restricted Tenders, out of which 167Â (48%) were approved, and 179Â (52%) rejected. Now here is the interesting part. The savings, made over the year as a result, amounted to some GHÂ¢800 million.
Mr Speaker, the savings are spectacular, and the figures are impressive, and, as my old Mathematics teacher and, I suspect, everybody elseâ€™s Mathematics teacher would say, you cannot argue with figures. We have taken the lessons to heart, and continue to improve upon the government procurement process. I said I would protect the public purse, and that is exactly what I am doing.
I believe it bears repeating here that, thanks to these boring figures, for the first time in a long while, we have been able to provide better budgetary support to the constitutionally-mandated institutions that hold government accountable, i.e. Auditor-General, Parliament, Judiciary, Ministry of Justice, Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), and the Police. Again, nowhere near the levels we would all like, but, when you are starting from inside a deep hole, it takes a while to make an impression on the ground, and the good thing is that we are pointing in the right direction.
Mr. Speaker, thanks to the diligence of the hardworking Minister for Employment and Labour Relations, Hon. Ignatius Baffuor Awuah, MP for Sunyani West, we have been able to transfer some GHÂ¢3.1 billion of Tier 2 pension funds into the custodial accounts of the pension schemes of the labour unions, funds that have been outstanding for six years, and about which the labour unions had been loudly complaining. As a result of engagements with organised labour, we ensured that the National Daily Minimum Wage was determined and approved before the laying of the 2018 budget by the Minister for Finance, and, happily, Mr. Speaker, there were no strike actions last year. We will continue the constructive dialogue with organised labour to find mutually satisfactory solutions to their concerns, in order to guarantee industrial peace.
Mr Speaker, we are, therefore, able to say with confidence that we are creating the atmosphere needed for the creation of jobs, easily the most urgent problem that faces the government and the nation. We have put in place the structures to help small and medium scale enterprises and budding entrepreneurs through the challenging start-up years. The availability of cheaper credit is good news for business in general, and means better prospects for jobs.
Mr. Speaker, the subject of job creation has to be at the top of my agenda. The number of young people, who cannot find work, is staggering, and a threat to our national security. I am determined to work to guarantee and secure the future of the young men and women of our country. Every major policy that my government has implemented in the past year has been essentially about the youth. We will equip the youth with the skills that will enable them to be productive. As a start, this government has established the Nation Builders Corps to employ 100,000 young persons, in 2018 alone, to assist in public sector service delivery in health, education, agriculture, sanitation and the revenue collection department of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA).
Stakeholders have had a series of meetings on this policy, and the modules have been designed for each of the designated areas. The details are currently being fine-tuned, and next month, this policy will formally take off to join the other youth employment initiatives. Just this morning, the respected Senior Minister, Yaw Osafo Maafo, launched the Digital Marketing and Entrepreneurship Programme at the Accra Digital Centre. This programme, with ten regional training centres, has already recruited 3,000 young, unemployed people, to undergo a 3-month all-expenses-paid training. I am happy to announce that Ecobank Ghana Ltd has already offered to engage all 3,000 young people, after the training programme. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
Mr Speaker, for years we have all talked about the need to open up our country. We have all acknowledged that we cannot hope to develop and transform our nation until we do so, and economic and administrative activities are spread around, and not restricted to the capital in Accra.
We have taken the clear and unambiguous mandate given to this government by the people of Ghana as a spur to take some of these long-promised actions, indeed, to open up our country and transform our economy. This year we are determined to take the decisions that would change the destiny of our country.
On the first working day of this year, I signed into law the Acts setting up the Development Authorities. Mr Speaker, the creation of these Authorities marks a fundamental change in how part of the development budget, i.e. the equivalent of $1 million per constituency per year, is going to be spent in our country.
Local people will make the decision on what their greatest needs are, and direct the funds to those areas. Luckily, there is some consensus on what constitutes the basic infrastructure needs in all communities, and we expect a smooth take-off in the work of these authorities. We are asking that everybody is guided by the priorities set up in the NPP Manifesto, on which we fought and won the mandate of the Ghanaian people. We expect, for example, the provision of water and toilets to feature prominently on the agenda of the Development Authorities, until those two items can be taken off the must-do list of all constituencies around the country. Sixty years after independence, the least we can, and should, do is to make sure that every Ghanaian has access to water and toilet facilities.
Mr Speaker, the state of sanitation in our cities is wholly unacceptable. Our cities have been engulfed by filth. There is the urgent need for public authorities to find means of making our cities clean, and, in the case of Accra, fulfilling my pledge, one of the most ambitious of my presidency, to make it the cleanest city in Africa, by the end of my term. Government is working with various private sector operators to tackle this major challenge, with strategies that are intended to effect a change in our attitudes towards waste generation, as well as to improve dramatically our methods of waste management.
This will be complemented by the strict enforcement of sanitation rules and regulations. Urgent attention will be given to clearing of rubbish all around the country. Apart from the systematic efforts being made to resolve the legacy of inherited debts in the sector, Government will spend, this year, an amount of GHÂ¢200 million to address the vexed issue of sanitation. I am confident that, by the time I come back next year, God willing, an appreciable improvement would have been made in the sanitation situation in the country.
Mr Speaker, there have been a number of ambitious decentralization exercises in this country. We are currently engaged in the very big exercise of creating new regions. It is a long and rather-complicated process. We are in unchartered territory, but all the indications are that it is going well, and I have been impressed to see political opponents come together to argue, for example, the case for the creation of an Oti or North Volta region. It is not often you see the veteran statesman, Dr Obed Asamoah, the vocal Mr Kofi Adams, and the Volta Regional Minister, Dr. Archibald Letsa, on the same side in a public argument. This portends well, and I believe this exercise will be a success, especially as it is being undertaken with scrupulous adherence to the teachings of the Constitution in this sensitive area, under the skilful direction of the experienced Minister for Regional Reorganisation and Development, Hon. Dan Botwe, MP for Okere.
Mr. Speaker, yet another ambitious decentralisation exercise is the expansion of full democracy to local government. A critical step, to this end, is the direct election of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives on a partisan basis. It is a firm manifesto commitment of the New Patriotic Party. Further, my discussions with the nationâ€™s political leaders, including the former Presidents of the Republic, convince me that it is a step we must take. The constitutional impediment to this, in Article 55 of the Constitution, an entrenched clause, must, therefore, be removed.
To ensure the judicious use of the countryâ€™s resources, I propose that the constitutional processes for a Referendum should be initiated in such a manner that the holding of the Referendum will take place at the same time as next yearâ€™s District Assembly elections. If successful, the outcome of the Referendum will mean that the current set of MMDCEs will be the last batch of Chief Executives to be appointed under the current system. I have no doubt that the resourceful Minister for Local Government and Rural Development, Hajia Alima Mahama, MP for Nalerigu Gambaga, will be able to shepherd this process to a positive conclusion.
But, Mr Speaker, I am convinced that the creation of new regions alone would not open up our country. That would not, on its own, convince our young people that they do not have to come to Accra to make a living. We have to improve upon the transportation system so that no part of this country feels cut off, or can be deemed to be too far from the centre.
That is one of the most effective ways to stop the unsustainable rush to Accra. Traffic jams and overcrowding are making our capital unattractive. There are certain inconveniences that people adjust to. Traffic jams are not one of them. We are spending too much time stuck in traffic, it is unproductive, it is not healthy, and it is expensive. I fear that one of these days one more car will join the madness on the roads in Accra, and our city will be completely gridlocked.
Mr Speaker, we have to build the roads to open up and link up the various parts of the country. Journey times between parts of the country have to be reduced. It is a shame that, someÂ sevenÂ years or so after work had started on the Eastern Corridor roads, we are nowhere near completion. And, yet, this is a strategic road, that would provide a much shorter and cheaper link between the southern and northern parts of our country, and a suitable, alternative route for our land-locked neighbours.
Unfortunately, this network of roads has suffered from deliberate, unproductive propaganda. It is hard to believe that, at a time when cocoa prices were going down, contracts were awarded for three sections of the road to be funded by COCOBOD. It comes as no surprise that COCOBOD has issued directives to suspend work on all three sections, which come up to almost 100 kilometres. Mr Speaker, we are determined to find the needed resources to complete the Eastern Corridor roads. As I have heard it said among the Ewes, that which is important, you cook in an important pot. Mr. Speaker,
There is a crying need for work to be done on all our roads. The Western Corridor, the Central Corridor, trunk roads, feeder roads, town roads, around the country, all require urgent attention. We are determined to bring our road network to a befitting status, and this year we shall witness much more activity on the roads.
In our current economic circumstances, we are turning our attention to private sector participation to raise the funds to do what needs to be done. I must make mention of the work being done to restore the Accra-Tema motorway to its iconic status. With help from Japan, a loyal friend of Ghana, work is starting to build a three-tier interchange at the motorway roundabout, and the plans for expansion into a six-lane motorway will be implemented from this year.
Mr Speaker, if we are to open up our country, we have to build a fast, safe and reliable railway network. Last year, I made a brave assertion in this House by stating that the Takoradi to Paga railway would be initiated in the year 2017. I am happy to report that we are making progress. We are in the final stages of agreeing with a significant investor the terms of a BOT Agreement, from Takoradi to Kumasi, which will be presented to Parliament this session.
There is already a contractor on site for the construction of the Kojokrom to Manso section of the Takoradi to Kumasi rail line. The process has commenced to select a suitable partner for the construction of the Eastern Line, from Accra to Tema to Kumasi. We aim to break ground this year. The Central Spine, from Kumasi to Paga, is also receiving attention, and consultants have been engaged to advise government on the best model for the development of the line.
Mr Speaker, with reference to the Ghana and Burkina Faso rail interconnectivity, the two countries are in earnest discussions as to the realisation of the project. There are fortnightly meetings, either in Accra or Ouagadougou, and we are confident that deliberations will conclude, and actual construction will commence by the third quarter of this year.
Mr Speaker, I know I am not saying anything new exactly; every government has said it, and it has been in every plan we have drawn up in this country since independence. But the difference this time is that we have started, and the dream of a modern railway network in our country will become a reality during the tenure of this administration.
Mr Speaker, a modern, reliable network of roads, railways, water transport and airports would transform our country, and I am delighted to note that fresh enthusiasm has entered the aviation sector, under the guidance of the dynamic Minister for Aviation, Cecilia Abena Dapaah, to link up all parts of the country by air.
Mr Speaker, the advance of technology means we can reach people, and get a lot done without much physical movement. The cyber population, that is busy on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media outlets, would testify that Ghana is very much part of the virtual world and its activities. More and more of us are banking, and paying our bills, online. A wealth of knowledge and information is now available on the net to make teaching and learning easier. We are working to make the child that sits in a classroom in Zebilla have the same opportunities as the child in a classroom in Ridge, in Accra. In their own way, these modern communication tools are opening up our country and the world to us all.
The start of the digital address system, the introduction of paperless transactions at our ports, the rapid and continuing spread of broadband services are all helping to formalise and modernise our economy, thanks to the creative leadership of the intrepid Minister for Communications, Hon. Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, MP for Ablekuma West. Furthermore, subsequent to Cabinet approval, the framework agreement between Ghana and the Republic of Mauritius, for an initial investment in the development of a technology park in Dawa, in the Greater Accra Region, has been ratified by Parliament for implementation to begin. Unfortunately, and predictably, a whole new set of dangers of cyber insecurity and fraud have emerged with these modern tools. We are working to strengthen cyber security to build confidence, and protect the use of electronic communications in national development, and ensure that our young technologically savvy people would keep Ghana firmly in the exciting IT economy and its many opportunities.
Mr Speaker, we need an educated and skilled workforce to be able to operate the modern economy we are creating. The Free SHS is a start towards this goal. It is a policy that has come to stay. We are reforming the schoolsâ€™ curricula to deal with the weaknesses in our education system, and lay greater emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (S.T.E.M), reading, history, and technical and vocational skills. A look at the national budget would tell you we are spending a lot of money on education, and I am certain that it is a worthwhile investment, being brilliantly supervised by that charismatic Minister for Education, Hon. Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Member of Parliament for Manhyia South. It is, in my view, also important that the reform of our schoolsâ€™ curricula should instil in our youth respect for the traditional values of discipline, fellow-feeling, hard work, honesty, integrity, and patriotism, without which no healthy, social development can occur.
In much the same way, we dare not compromise on the health of the population. We have cleared a substantial part of the debts and arrears that were choking the National Health Insurance Scheme, courtesy of the prudent management of the able chartered accountant, Health Minister Hon. Kwaku Agyemang Manu, MP for Dormaa Central. This has led to the revival of the NHIS, and the renewal of respect for the NHIS card. The health needs of our people are being better served. Moreover, as we work to open up the country, I hope that our efforts at improving the conditions of work for health workers would be appreciated, and there would no longer be the reluctance to serve in some parts of Ghana.
Mr. Speaker, in line with our commitment to building a fair and inclusive society, we promised, last year, to increase the share of the District Assemblies Common Fund to Persons With Disabilities from 2 percent to 3 percent, and we delivered. Effective July last year, the policy of ensuring that 50% of the persons who manage the countryâ€™s toll booths are Persons With Disabilities started. Nonetheless, we are determined to address the other concerns of Persons living With Disabilities.
A healthy nation, Mr Speaker, is a well-fed nation. For generations, we have bemoaned Ghanaâ€™s reliance solely on rain-fed agriculture. This means the slightest change in the rainfall pattern exposed our farmers to the loss of a seasonâ€™s harvest. It is a disgrace that we have had to rely on our Sahelian neighbours to make up the deficit in foods, such as vegetables.
This year, the One-Village-One-Dam project starts full operation. It is a simple, low-tech project, but these dams will make a big difference to all our lives and the livelihoods of our farmers. Already, many of the little dams that had been abandoned, have been rehabilitated and brought back into use. A deliberate and specific intervention to help farmers is paying off. Our farmers can see that the government is putting resources to back up the usual words. The 50% subsidy on fertilizer, and the increase in the provision of extension services, are making a great difference to the performance of Ghanaian agriculture.
Under the Planting for Food and Jobs scheme, we are witnessing a fresh interest in farming. The success of the first year has encouraged us to increase the scope of the programme, and, this year, some half a million farmers would be signed on, up from the figure of two hundred thousand (200,000) last year. That champion of Ghanaian farmers, the Minister for Food and Agriculture, Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, is doing a yeomanâ€™s job.
Mr. Speaker, fishing in our country, an industry that provides a living for ten percent of the population, has been bedeviled by many problems in the past. The fishing harvest has gone down dramatically, and we have had to depend more and more on imported fish. We have started work to tackle these problems. This past year, we made sure that the close season was respected not just by the industrial tuna vessels, but, also, by the trawlers. We will adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, which should help us replenish our depleted stocks.
More effective measures are being taken against illegal, unreported and unregulated methods of fishing. We have also instituted measures to avert premix diversions, and strict auditing of landing beaches are in place. I can state that, since November, there has been no report of premix diversion, a marked improvement from the past. Mr. Speaker, I believe that the future lies in the promotion of aquaculture, and we have set about it with a lot of enthusiasm. We have identified 100 dams in five regions across the country â€“ Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Volta and Western â€“ and stocked them with fingerlings. This is the start of big things to come, due to the efforts of the forceful Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture, Hon. Elizabeth Afoley Quaye, MP for Krowor.
Mr Speaker, agriculture forms the backbone of our flagship 1-District-1-Factory programme. The majority of the proposals that have been evaluated and accepted for support under the scheme are agro-based. It is food processing, after all, that has been the take-off point for industrialization in most developed societies. It also fits in with our determination to open up our country, and make jobs and facilities available in all parts of the country.
Mr Speaker, problems associated with our environment and the galamsey phenomenon have taken up a lot of the time and energy of this government. The fight against galamsey is being spearheaded by a high-powered Inter-Ministerial Committee, led by the globally-acclaimed Ghanaian scientist, Prof. Kwabena Frimpong Boateng, Minister for Science, Technology, Environment and Innovation, supported by the indefatigable Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, John Peter Amewu. This Committee is waging a valiant struggle to bring the galamsey phenomenon under control. Its work has received, thankfully, the wide support of the media. Mr Speaker, we have had to ban small-scale mining for the pastÂ . We acknowledge that the banning of small-scale mining cannot be the long-term solution in a country such as ours, which is blessed with so many minerals; but, as the saying goes, desperate situations call for desperate remedies.
We cannot look on, as our very existence as a country is put in jeopardy and our water bodies, forests and land mass are destroyed. Even with the ban, it has been a never-ending battle with the galamseyers, and I am sure the House will want to join me, in paying tribute to the members of our forces in the Operation Vanguard that are protecting our environment. They are Ghanaian patriots of the first order. We have started various schemes to find sustainable alternative sources of income for the galamsayers. Mr Speaker, nothing will ever equate the attraction of the search for gold or diamond, and maybe the drama of actually finding some, but this generation of Ghanaians dares not preside over the destruction of our lands. The state of our rivers and forests remains a great cause for worry, and it is our sacred duty to protect them. I hope I can count on the total support of the House to help nurse our degraded lands and rivers back to health.
I am equally grateful to those chiefs, who have supported the fight against galamsey. My government will continue to reach out to our traditional rulers, so that, together, we can address pressing issues facing our nation, and its peace and stability.
Mr Speaker, there is relief in some areas, and I refer specifically to the spectacular improvement in our power supply problems. A lot of hard work has gone into easing the intolerable debt situation that threatened to paralyse the energy industry. We still have problems with the cost of power, and we are working to put Ghana at a competitive advantage. Â We intend to find private sector operators to buy into the state owned thermal plants, and inject the capital needed to bring power tariffs down for both domestic and commercial consumers. The most reliable, and, ultimately, cheapest answer to our power needs, lies with renewable energy sources. We shall promote and enthusiastically encourage investment and use of renewable energy. I am sure that the House shares my relief that DUMSOR is no longer part of our everyday lexicon. Long may it stay so, as we applaud the efforts of the tireless Minister, Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko.
Mr Speaker, the safety and security of our people are at the heart of all that we do. Ghanaian citizens have a right to expect to go about their daily lives in an atmosphere of peace. A Ghanaian has a right to expect that those who break the law must be subjected to the sanctions laid down under the law. The police, the prosecution services and the judiciary owe it to all of us to make us feel and be safe. I do not need to repeat that crime wears no political colours, and I am certain that message has gone down to all. Mr Speaker, the law enforcement agencies will crack down very hard on all those who would disturb the peace of our nation. We will give the Police the resources they need to do their job. An initial amount of GHÂ¢800 million is being made available to procure and supply, within the next six months, critical, modern policing equipment and gadgets to enhance the capacity of the police to enforce law and order, including one thousand (1,000) vehicles, motorbikes, and ammunition. The equipment is to facilitate visibility, mobility and improved responsiveness of the police to ensure a safe, secure and peaceful economic and social environment for Ghanaians to work and thrive. Already, the successful renegotiation of existing contracts has enabled us purchase, forthwith, 100 vehicles for the Police.
In the medium to long-term, we will purchase drones and helicopters to assist the police combat violent and environmental crime. The crime laboratories will be modernised, and properly equipped to provide the necessary support. The police intelligence unit will also be strengthened. The perennial problems associated with police accommodation will be tackled, and a compensation package introduced to cover officers in their line of duty.
Mr. Speaker, I am aware that the entire nation is extremely anxious and perturbed by the activities of the migrant, nomadic herdsmen in the country. We are rehabilitating the kraals or ranches that were abandoned after the Kufuor-led NPP government left office in 2009. They will become operational shortly to provide secure, grazing places for cattle. At the same time, efforts are also being intensified to find an ECOWAS-wide solution to an issue, which goes beyond the boundaries of our country, and is affecting the entire West African region.
Mr Speaker, we shall not allow miscreants of any sort to terrorize our population; and I promise that there will be no hiding place for criminals. I am certain that the interventions we are introducing will boost morale in the service, and I urge the House and all citizens to support the police to deliver the service we deserve. The formidable Minister for the Interior, Hon. Ambrose Dery, MP for Nandom, needs our effective co-operation to carry out his all-important functions.
In much the same way, we are beginning to address the problems of our Armed Forces. I am happy to report that work has started on the Barracks Regeneration Programme. The acute accommodation problems that face our Armed Forces must be, and are now being tackled by that energetic Minister for Defence, Hon. Dominic Nitiwul, MP for Bimbilla. We know that it is in all our interests, that those charged with ensuring our security, and who put their lives on the line for our safety, are able to concentrate on their jobs without distractions like inadequate and inappropriate housing. It is vital that all of us give maximum support to the noble and brave men and women of our security services, involved in Operation Calm Life, Operation Vanguard, and Operation Cow Leg, aimed at guaranteeing the safety of our people, the integrity of our environment, and the peace of our nation.
Mr Speaker, the housing deficit is not limited to our security services, it is a nationwide problem that is caused mostly by the intolerable pressure on land prices. This has put affordable housing out of the reach of most people. We have begun the difficult process of making housing affordable for Ghanaians. Government, last year, abolished the 5% VAT/NHIL on real estate sales, and continues to create a conducive environment that is reducing interest rates on mortgage loans. Discussions are also on-going between the Pensions Regulatory Authority and the Banks to underwrite an effective mortgage system. This will facilitate access to housing for the ordinary budget. Government will also continue to create the enabling environment that will promote private sector investment in cheaper housing for the people.
Mr Speaker, I am sure no one needs reminding in this House that I have signed into law, the Office of Special Prosecutor Act, an essential step in our overall strategy to combat corruption. I look forward to the House dealing speedily with the process of confirmation of the nominee, a person of proven professional ability, with an established record of integrity and independence of character. Here again, we are in unchartered waters, but I am convinced that there is enough goodwill in the country to propel the first occupant of this position into setting a good and firm foundation for the position of the Special Prosecutor.
Mr Speaker, year in, year out, the nationâ€™s Auditor-General produces a report on our public finances. It is often full of grand cases of corruption in our public services. The Auditor-Generalâ€™s Report on MDA liabilities as at 31Â December, 2016, makes truly alarming reading. I make reference to the fact that a staggering amount of GHÂ¢5.4 billion has been identified as constituting fictitious claims. In the course of this address, Mr Speaker, the House has heard me struggle to identify a source of funding to build our roads. Every day, we hear reports on our radios and televisions of dilapidated classrooms, and children who sit on floors at school. Just think of the difference that GHÂ¢5.4 billion would make to the nationâ€™s finances. That would certainly be enough to build and furnish hundreds of classrooms, and construct the Eastern Corridor roads. Every citizen is affected by acts of corruption, and we should all work to tackle them. Government has an obligation to treat the Auditor-Generalâ€™s Report seriously, and to work to retrieve illegally acquired monies from those who would impoverish us all. The role of OccupyGhana, in increasing awareness of the importance of the work of the Auditor-General, should be recognised.
Mr. Speaker, the Preamble to the Constitution of the Republic enjoins each one of us to uphold the principles of Freedom and Justice, Probity and Accountability. In furtherance of these principles, I have made it publicly known that anyone, who has information about acts of corruption by any of my appointees, should bring it forward, and should be prepared to back it up with evidence, for I will have it investigated. So far, every single alleged act of corruption levelled against any of my appointees has been investigated by independent bodies, and, in some cases, by Parliament itself, and the findings made public. From the allegations against the Minister-Designate for Energy at his parliamentary confirmation hearings; to that against the CEO of BOST; to those against the two deputy Chiefs of Staff; to the conflict of interest allegations against the Minister for Finance; and, most recently, to the claims of extortion against the Trade and Industry Minister â€“ they have all been investigated, and no evidence has been adduced to suggest any act of corruption, conflict of interest or wrongdoing. It appears, however, that some are determined to stick to their politically-motivated view that there has been corruption. This, surely, is not helpful. It is important to note that, in my first year of office, despite having a clear parliamentary majority, two separate bi-partisan probes in Parliament have been established to inquire into allegations of corruption, as against zero in recent years, notwithstanding the persistent calls by the then Minority over several allegations. Mr. Speaker, with the greatest of respect, and in the words of the articulate Minister for Information, Mustapha Abdul-Hamid, no matter how long a log stays under water, it will never become a crocodile.
Mr. Speaker, there was great relief around the country when the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found in our favour in the maritime boundary dispute with Cote dâ€™Ivoire, a dispute which was litigated by successive governments in the national interest, the last lap being run by the able Attorney General, Ms Gloria Akuffo. In our celebrations, we did not forget that good neighbourliness is the hallmark of our foreign policy, and I am glad to state that our good relations with Cote dâ€™Ivoire have not been affected in any way by the resolution of the dispute. Indeed, Cote dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s renowned President, His Excellency M. Alassane Ouattara, at my invitation, paid us a memorable, official visit, after the ruling, to underline his countryâ€™s determination to maintain, if not deepen, its good relations with our own.
In fact, as you may remember, he and I signed, on that occasion, Lâ€™Accord Strategique de Parteniariat (A Strategic Partnership Agreement, for those who find French difficult), to emphasise the enhanced relationship we both seek for our two neighbouring countries. Another obvious, immediate benefit from the sensible reaction of both sides to the outcome of the dispute is the subsequent agreement by ExxonMobil, the worldâ€™s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, to explore and develop, with us, potentially rich oil blocks that were affected by the dispute.
Mr. Speaker, much as we all recognise the importance of exploiting the offshore hydrocarbon resources of our nation, I think it equally critical for us not to ignore the possibilities of our onshore deposits, especially in the Voltaian Basin. So, last year, I directed our state-owned oil development company, the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), to pay particular attention to this potential. It is good to hear that that directive appears to be yielding dividends, as GNPC, from the results of its pilot survey in the Voltaian basin, has established the presence of a working petroleum system. I hope that, eventually, there will be something big for us to cheer about.
Mr. Speaker, this year, we will continue the process of passing the Legislative Instruments of the National Youth and Sports Act, pursue the enactment of the draft National Sports College Bill, and create a Sports Fund to improve sports development in the country. Government also remains committed to the development of football in the country. We have begun the rehabilitation of the Accra Sports Stadium, aka Ohene Djan Sports Stadium, and in partnership with the Inner City and Zongo Development Ministry and the Ghana Football Association, we are constructing a number of football pitches in the Zongos and across the rest of the country, to aid in the revival of colts football, which has been responsible for the production of talents like Abedi Pele and Tony Yeboah. We need to catch the talents at a young age, if Ghanaian football is to continue with its traditions of excellence, and perform well on the national and international stage.
Mr Speaker, we, in Ghana, are proud members of regional, continental and global communities. Since my inauguration, I have been active, with the help of the eloquent Foreign Minister, Hon. Shirley Ayorkor Botchway, MP for Anyaa Sowutuom, in keeping up and promoting the historical role of Ghana within these communities, a role of independent, sovereign action in the supreme interest of the Ghanaian and African peoples. I have travelled around our neighbourhood and beyond, and I am glad to report that the Black Star is shining.Â It is the reason for the unprecedented numbers of world leaders â€“ African, Asian and European â€“ who have thronged our shores this past year, and enjoyed our renowned Ghanaian hospitality. It explains also the warmth with which I am greeted wherever I go in the world.
Mr Speaker, a countryâ€™s image turns on the most unlikely things and events. It could be because of the exploits of a football team, like Brazil, it could be because of the exploits of one athlete, like Frankie Fredericks for Namibia or Maria Mutola for Mozambique, it could be because of a highlife connoisseur like E.T. Mensah for Ghana, a singer/trumpeter like Hugh Masekela for South Africa. The image of a country can be made forever, because of a William Shakespeare or an Anton Chekov or a Chinua Achebe or an Ayi Kwei Amarh. The image could hinge simply on a Mona Lisa painting or a David Adjayeâ€™s inspired structure.
I am, therefore, very much aware that we have to create the space and atmosphere for our artists and creatives, and we shall support them. The foundations for the passing of the Creative Arts Bill have been laid, and, ultimately, processes for the setting up of the Creative Arts Fund will be completed to enable our creative artists to access funds to boost their art.
Mr Speaker, as we make progress in our undertakings, more and more people will come to Ghana to find things out for themselves, to conduct business and, increasingly, simply as tourists to experience our country and enjoy themselves. I am happy to report that we have now recognized the need to go further than our reputation for being hospitable. We are building a Ghana, where tourists will feel at home, and we shall feel proud when they say â€œI was in Ghana.â€ On December 15, 2017, I joined the chiefs and people of Osu and Gbese to cut the sod for the 241-acre Accra Marine Drive Project. This project, during construction and upon completion, will generate thousands of jobs for the local community and across the value chain, and position Ghana as a key tourism destination.
Mr Speaker, I have an apology to make to the House. I promised last year we would endeavour to pass into law the Affirmative Action Bill. This did not happen. My commitment to the promotion of the advancement of women is without question. Women constitute the majority of the population, and our success or otherwise as a nation will be measured by how well women are doing. The Bill will definitely come to Parliament this session.
In the meantime, I have thrown my full weight behind the HeforShe campaign, and the Gender and Development Initiative for Africa (GADIA), an initiative stemming from my position as the African Unionâ€™s Gender Champion. I urge all Ghanaian males to join together in giving Ghanaian females the dignity they deserve, as tenaciously promoted by the polyglot Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection, Otiko Afisa Djaba. I further entreat all of us, male and female, to support the implementation of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which have been incorporated into Â Governmentâ€™s Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, which was laid before this House on 13Â November, 2017, and the execution of which will ensure that no Ghanaian is left behind.
Mr Speaker, on 7Â January, the 4Â Republic attained 25 years of age, its Silver Jubilee. It has proved to be the most enduring and most successful of the four republics of our history. Its Constitution has enabled us to establish our State on sound democratic principles, on the basis of the separation of powers, the rule of law and respect for human rights. It has witnessed three peaceful transitions, through the ballot box, from one democratically elected government of one party, to another of another party. It has promoted our nation as a beacon of stability, and a model of democratic engagement on the African continent. It was to celebrate this collective achievement of the Ghanaian people and the unity of the Ghanaian nation that I organised, on that day, an inter-faith religious ceremony of thanksgiving to Almighty God, graced by the presence of my three predecessors, their Excellencies the 1, 2Â and 4Â Presidents of the 4Â Republic, Jerry John Rawlings, John Agyekum Kufuor and John Dramani Mahama. I thank them for their contribution to the service, and thank all the Eminent Clergy, of both the Christian and Islamic persuasions, who conducted and participated in the solemn, moving ceremony. Long may the 4Â Republic flourish.
Mr Speaker, our nation is on the right path. We will build a Ghana Beyond Aid. I thank you very much for your attention. May God bless us all, our Parliament, and our nation Ghana, and make her great and strong.
I am very glad to be amongst you this morning, at the opening of the 2018 West African Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition, and to engage with you, leaders of the mining and power sectors of the economy. This event is an important platform to bring together various stakeholders in two of the most prized sectors of our economy, as we work together to chart a path of economic prosperity for our nation.   

Ladies and gentlemen, as we mark the 90th Anniversary of the Chamber of Mines, the theme chosen for this year’s event, “A Responsible and Sustainable Mining Industry, A Partner for National Development” is most opportune. 

For nine decades, the Chamber’s role as a leading business association has been exemplary. The Chamber’s intimate connection with the mining sector has resulted in many partnerships with key state institutions. The Chamber’s reputation, built on the back of nine decades of commitment to upholding the interests of its members, is enviable. I commend the diverse contributions of its member companies to making Ghana’s large-scale mining sector a critical component of our nation’s economic growth.

As I have said on several other occasions, since the Almighty has blessed our land with many minerals, mining has been, and will always be part of the activities that define the Ghanaian people. The challenge we face is not whether we mine or do not mine: it is about how to undertake mining in a sustainable and responsible manner. Mining provides many of us with a source of living, but we all have a collective responsibility to ensuring that mining activities do not leave our lands degraded, and rob future generations of a safe and habitable environment.

There is no question, but that, after all these years, we have not maximized the benefits of mining, and there remains a lot to learn of best practices from other places, so that we can protect the environment and reap maximum reward from the exploitation of our mineral resources.

Some gains have been made; but many challenges remain, and it is time to address them.

The mining sector makes very important contributions to the generation of our country’s revenue. According to the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), except for 2014, in the past six years, the mining sector has provided the largest tax base. But the truth must be told: it is difficult for the average Ghanaian to appreciate that the country gains substantially from mining. It probably has to do with the fact that the communities in which mining has been done remain largely underdeveloped, and do not show signs of being the origins of what brings wealth to so many people and places. For years we were told the mine in Obuasi was the richest gold mine in the world. The question is justifiably asked: how come Obuasi does not show any sign that it is the home of the richest gold mine in the world? The contrast between Obuasi and Johannesburg, for example, is stark and compelling.    

Ladies and gentlemen, as in now well-known, our nation faces a grave difficulty with the activities of illegal miners or galamsayers, as we call them. This is a problem that should be of great concern to the large-scale mining sector, and the Chamber of Mines as well. The rise in illegal mining has, no doubt, been fueled not only by the unemployment problem that has blighted our nation for so long, but also by the unhealthy desire for quick riches. 

There must be a lot of opportunities in the mining sector to help with the unemployment of our youth. I refer, in particular, to our “One-District-One-Factory” programme as an avenue through which we can enter the value chain addition of the mining industry. A large amount of spending by mining companies leaks from the domestic economy through the importation of several tools and equipment, which Ghana has the capacity to produce. It is time to reverse this trend. Ghanaian entrepreneurs must be encouraged to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Chamber to identify opportunities in the value chain, where indigenous companies can manufacture these products locally. 

I know that mining inputs, such as caustic soda, activated carbon and grinding media, can be produced locally if businesses produce at competitive prices, in the needed quantities and the right quality. The readily available raw materials for some of the inputs mean that there is great potential for interested investors. This is your sector. I should not be enumerating the details for you. It is enough to say that it is time to produce locally many of the inputs that you currently import. The mining sector ought to be a captive market for the 1D-1F initiative. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Ghana has been touted as one of the countries with the fastest growth potential in the coming years. This growth, according to a study by the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), is based largely on the strong performance of the extractives sector. The mining extractive sector, however, is no longer a large employer of labour due to improvement in the deployment of technology and innovation. We must necessarily, therefore, stimulate job creation in an integrated manner through the value chain of the extractives sector.

The extractives sector, particularly mining, can help rapidly to grow our manufacturing sector. Government is empowering the private sector to create jobs and wealth by working closely with industry and academia to equip young professionals with the skills required to operate competitively in the sector. 

We are establishing a new paradigm of an integrated mining industry to propel local manufacturing. The value chain of mining has huge potential for job-creation, and we intend to tap into it to develop our economy. We cannot, and should not continue to be merely exporters of raw materials to other countries. I call on all players in the sector to work with us to deepen the integration of the mining sector with the non-mineral sectors of the economy.

Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my remarks, I made reference to the state of mining communities in our country. Why is Obuasi not the most beautiful city in Ghana or the world, if it hosts the richest gold mine; why do Tarkwa and Prestea not look like the golden towns they are, and why does Akwatia’s appearance not reflect anything about the diamonds that have been taken from its soils all these years? The distressed state of communities in which mining companies operate is nothing short of a disgrace, and we must work to change the situation. Even though mining companies have, over the years, complemented the work of government in these communities, I am certain that a lot more can be done to transform the communities if government and the mining companies collaborate in an intelligent and sustainable manner.

The Minerals Development Fund Act (2016), Act 912, was enacted to address some of these problems, and my government is working to ensure that the Act is fully operational to provide financial resources to transform mining communities. We are aware that the delay, in rolling out structures for operationalizing the MDF Act, is affecting development in mining communities and, indeed, the way in which mining is viewed in some sections of the community at large. Let me assure you that the MDF Act will be functional very soon to serve as the vehicle for development in the host communities. The Board of Trustees of the Minerals Development Fund will also be inaugurated shortly to enable it to play its expected governance role under the Minerals Development Fund Act. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I am looking forward to the implementation of the National Assay Programme. This should remove all doubts and set everybody’s mind at ease regarding the volume and value of gold legitimately exported by the sector, particularly by gold producing members of the Chamber. This is an exercise which is long overdue, and has mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders.

That is why I commend the Chamber and the mining companies for the decision to work with the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), which has been appointed as the national assayer, to assay all bullion being exported out of the country for both small scale and large-scale mining companies. Even though the PMMC does not presently have the requisite technology to be fully operational, they now have a strong incentive to build their capacity and transform their operations. I am confident they will do so expeditiously.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is well-known that power is critical to industry in general, and, especially so, for an energy intensive sector such as the mining sector. The triple elements of the requirements of an adequate, reliable and cost-effective power supply are fundamental to success across all sectors of industry. We need reliable and cost competitive power supply to be able to translate into reality our desire for harnessing linkage opportunities and value addition to our gold, bauxite, iron ore and other minerals. 

We must salute the PURC for implementing a 10% reduction in power tariffs a few months ago for the mining companies, as government had requested, and urge them to work to find scope for further reduction to help stimulate industry.

It is our desire to review continually the energy mix, and cost of power generation for competitive cost-effective power tariffs. A concentration on cost competitive generation and transmission of power should allow us to trade excess power under the West Africa Power Pool within the ECOWAS Region.

Ladies and gentlemen, mining invariably involves interference with the landscape and, unless great care is taken, it usually means serious degradation of the lands and water bodies. We have had to take the very tough decision to place a ban on all small-scale mining, because of the alarming destruction of our environment. The ban is meant to be a temporary measure, until we are able to streamline and regulate the small-scale mining sector. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, led by its dynamic Minister, John Peter Amewu, has worked on the Multi-Sectoral Mining Integrated Project (MMIP) to provide the needed framework to streamline small scale mining, and provide avenues for alternative employment for the galamseyers. I am aware that the Chamber made inputs to the production of the MMIP, which were very welcome. 

It must be said that the degradation of the environment in mining is not done only by illegal or small-scale miners. Large-scale mining companies have also been known to flout the rules, and degrade and, sometimes, pollute our water bodies. It is, therefore, essential that we quickly strengthen the regulatory institutions so that they can vigorously enforce environmental, health and safety laws to protect our people, our ecology and our future. 
As you will recall, I made a pledge of an annual contribution of five million Ghana cedis towards the construction of the new campus at Wassa Fiase of the George Grant University of Mines and Technology (GGUMaT), during the investiture of the 2nd President of the 4th Republic, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, as its Chancellor. Being the primary tertiary institution that trains technical human resources for the mining industry, it is expected, as happens in other jurisdictions, that the mining sector will be at the forefront of supporting this University. I appeal to the members of the Chamber to commit to supporting this all important University through their corporate social investment initiatives.

Let me, in concluding, commend, again, the leadership of the Chamber and the organisers of the West Africa Mining and Power Conference and Exhibition for putting together such a worthwhile event. As President of the Republic, it is my duty and desire actively to promote responsible and sustainable mining for the good of generations yet unborn.

I wish you happy and fruitful interactions and deliberations, and I now formally declare the West Africa Mining and Power Conference open, and the Exhibition duly launched.

May God bless us, and all the peoples of West Africa, and make our Region great and strong. Thank you for your attention.
