"President Akufo-Addo has assured the first female vice-chancellor of the University of Ghana, Professor Nana Aba Appiah Amfo of his full support to help her succeed in office."
"Speaking at the induction ceremony of Prof Amfo on Tuesday on the Legon campus, the President said the reforming process of the country’s educational system requires government to provide support to leaders of educational institutions."
“Our country is undergoing some significant reforms in its educational system. The most far-reaching of which is the significant broadening of access to education at all levels of educational structure.

"“It is as well that it should be so. We need to mobilise all the talents and resources of the entire population without discrimination or reserve to make the decisive push for the social and economic transformation which we all seek for our beloved nation of Ghana,” Akufo-Addo said."
President Akufo-Addo expressed his confidence in the newly appointed Vice-Chancellor to execute a formidable task.
"“Those who have the privilege of leadership in our educational structure have unprecedented challenges before them. I am confident that the premier university, the status that would be attached to Legon forever, has in our new vice-chancellor, chosen a person who would be adequate for this formidable task.”"
"“You will definitely have my support and I will be hopefully, your successful advocate with the minister for finance,” Akufo-Addo noted."
President Akufo-Addo congratulated the university council under the leadership of the former Chief Justice Sophia Akuffo for their decision  to appoint Professor Nana Aba Appiah Amfo as the vice-chancellor of the University of Ghana.
"“With the female Chancellor in the person of Mary Chiney-Hesse, males in the academic hierarchy of Legon may well begin to feel a threatened species. I believe they have no cause to worry. It just happens to be the time of the women. It is ok, they have waited long enough,” the President said."
