Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, says President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo ought to be blamed for his lack of responsibility leading towards the unwarranted levels of violence recorded during the 2020 general elections.	
The MP maintains that the failure of the President to ensure that the various security agencies handled events during the polls in a more appropriate manner must be something the President must be ashamed of.	
Mr. Ablakwaâ€™s comment comes on the back of a petition he and another colleague legislator â€“ Ellembelle MP, Emmanuel Kofi Buah,Â  have presented to the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to probe the violence and the killings.	
â€œThe buck stops on the leadership. The Commander-in-Chief of the Ghana Armed Forces, the President himself, must be embarrassed that this happened under his watch. He is the Chair of the National Security Council,â€ Mr. Ablakwa said on .	Eyewitness News
	
Many MPs on the minority side of Parliament have taken steps through the [private memberâ€™s motion] seeking a full-scale probe into acts of violence that occurred during the 2020 polls.	
They want the scope of the probe to factor in inappropriate interferences by state security in the elections and violence against citizens, leading to the loss of lives insisting thatÂ the IGP, and other security agencies reneged on a promise to Parliament and Ghanaians to protect lives.	
The latest is the petition by Messrs Ablakwa and Armah Buah .	invoking CHRAJâ€™s legal mandate to investigate the conduct of security officers in the election
The petition from the MPs is lodged against the Ministers for Interior and Defence, the Inspector General of Police, and the Chief of Defence staff.	
â€œThat is why in our complaints, we have not left out the politicians because they are the beneficiaries of these shenanigans when they occur. So the Minister of Defence has been cited in this petition. The Minister of Interior because they are in charge and serve on the National Security Council. So we are not stopping at the level of the IGP or Chief of Defense Staff, although they have been citedâ€, Mr. Ablakwa added.	
TheÂ  Petition	
The petition filed by the two MPs is restricted to the Techiman South, Odododiodio, Ablekuma Central, and Savelugu constituencies in the Bono East, Greater Accra, and Northern Regions of the Republic of Ghana respectively.	
â€œThe complainants herein bring this matter before the Commission based on the Commissionâ€™s legal mandate to investigate the conduct of the security officers complained about in the instant petition in a timeous manner for justice to prevail for the victims and their familiesâ€, parts of the petition read.	
The legislators argue that a review of the documents and video footage accompanying their complaint shows that, the victims were indeed injured and killed by the direct conduct or actions of uniformed officers and the National Election Security Taskforce (NESTF) during the elections.	
In furtherance, they said, the evidence also points to a display of needless and unjustifiable brute and excessive force incommensurate with the actual threat with disregard for other less fatal options for the purpose.	
The petition added that â€œthe complainants finally demand that the investigation identify the role played by the Ministers of the Interior and Defence in terms of instructions and orders in relation to the conduct resulting in this complaint, and the lack of leadership or proper oversight to prevent, stop or respond in a manner to curb the violations that have occurredâ€.	
Reliefs	
The MPs are therefore seeking the following reliefs from CHRAJ:	
Investigations into the matters complained about	Compensation to victims or families of victims

Fellow Ghanaians,	
I have come into your homes, again, this evening to provide an update, as I promised, on the measures taken by Government to combat the Coronavirus pandemic.	
You may recall that on Wednesday, 12th March, 2020, when I first spoke to you directly on this matter, I announced the first raft of enhanced measures taken in response to the pandemic. At the time, there had been no reported, confirmed case of the Coronavirus in Ghana.	
Since then, six (6) confirmed cases have been announced, all of people who recently travelled into the country. Advisories on how to manage the developments have also been announced by the Ministries of Health and Information. Public education is being intensified to ensure that citizens are well advised on preventive measures.	
Earlier today, Sunday, 15th March, 2020, I chaired a meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Coronavirus response. After deliberations, I have decided, in the interest of public safety and the protection of our population, to review the public gathering advisories earlier announced as follows:	
1	All public gatherings, including conferences, workshops, funerals, festivals, political rallies, sporting events and religious activities, such as services in churches and mosques, have been suspended for the next four (4) weeks. Private burials are permitted, but with limited numbers, not exceeding twenty-five (25) in attendance;
2	All Universities, Senior High Schools, and basic schools, i.e. public and private schools, will be closed Monday, 16th March, 2020, till further notice. The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication, has been tasked to roll out distance learning programmes. However, BECE and WASSCE candidates will be allowed to attend school to prepare for their examinations, but with prescribed social distancing protocols;
3	The Government of Ghanaâ€™s Travel Advisory issued earlier today should be observed as announced;
4	Businesses and other workplaces can continue to operate, but should observe prescribed social distancing between patrons and staff;
5	Establishments, such as supermarkets, shopping malls, restaurants, night clubs, hotels and drinking spots, should observe enhanced hygiene procedures by providing, amongst others, hand sanitizers, running water and soap for washing of hands;
6	The Ministry of Transport should work with the transport unions and private and public transport operators to ensure enhanced hygienic conditions in all vehicles and terminals, by providing, amongst others, hand sanitizers, running water and soap for washing of hands; and
7	The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development should co-ordinate, with the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies, measures to enhance conditions of hygiene in markets across the country.
Additionally, as the experts conduct contact tracing, I appeal to all to co-operate with them to ensure that persons who have come into contact with positive cases are identified and supported.	
I have directed the Attorney General to submit, immediately, to Parliament emergency legislation, in accordance with Article 21 (4) (c) & (d) of the Constitution of the Republic, to embody these measures, and I have further directed the Minister for Health to exercise his powers, under section 169 of the Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851), by the immediate issuance of an Executive Instrument, to govern the relevant measures. I call upon Parliament to support the Executive in this national endeavour.	
As I said earlier, there is every need to observe prescribed social distancing and good personal hygiene to prevent community spread. We are determined to do whatever we can to prevent the spread of the virus, and protect the population. All the measures that have been announced will be subject to constant review and enhancement, if necessary.	
Fellow Ghanaians, these are not ordinary times, so, let us all put our shoulders to the wheel, and I am confident that, together, by the Grace of God, we shall overcome this challenge.	
May God bless us all, and our homeland Ghana, and make her great and strong.	
I thank you for your attention.
